Que: IAM with Terraform
Ans: In this lab, we will learn how to deploy AWS resources using Terraform with the same mocking service that we use in the AWS CLI lab.

Que: Let's start off by creating an IAM User called mary but this time by making use of Terraform. In the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/IAM, create a file called iam-user.tf with the following specifications:
Resource Type: aws_iam_user
Resource Name: users
Name: mary
Once the file has been created, run terraform init.
Ans:
resource "aws_iam_user" "users" {
name = "mary"
}
Que:
terraform init command ran successfully.
Great! We now have a configuration file with a simple resource block for creating an IAM User with Terraform!
Let's check if everything is in order for us to create this resource.
Run terraform plan within this configuration.
Ans: No

Que: Why did the previous command fail?
Error: Invalid AWS Region: 
│ 
│   with provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws"],
│   on <empty> line 0:
Ans: Region is not set

Que: Add a new file called provider.tf containing a provider block for aws.Inside this block add a single argument called region with the value ca-central-1
You don't have to run a terraform plan or apply at this stage.
Ans: 
provider "aws" {
region = "ca-central-1"

}


Que: Run a terraform plan now. Does it work?
Ans: No

Que: Great! We have added one user called mary. However, project_sapphire has 5 more people who need access to the AWS Account!
Let's use the count meta-argument and the new variables.tf file created in the configuration directory to create these additional users!

What is the name of the variable that has been added to the variables.tf file?
Ans: 
variable "project-sapphire-users" {
type = list(string)
default = [ "mary", "jack", "jill", "mack", "buzz", "mater"]
}

Ans  project-sapphire-users

Que: What is the data type used for the variable called project-sapphire-users?
Ans: list(string)

Now, update the iam-user.tf to make use of the count meta-argument to loop through the project-sapphire-users variable and create all the users in the list.
You may want to make use of the length function to get the length of the list.
