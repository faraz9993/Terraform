Que: A new configuration directory has been created at /root/terraform-projects/project-shade. Inspect it. How many files will be created by this configuration?
Ans: 
resource "local_sensitive_file" "name" {
filename = "/root/user-data"
content = "password: S3cr3tP@ssw0rd"
}
Ans: 1

Que: Now add a count argument to create 3 instances of this resource.
When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply
Ans: Improvised code:
resource "local_sensitive_file" "name" {
filename = "/root/user-data"
content = "password: S3cr3tP@ssw0rd"
count = 3
}
terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply commands ran successfully.

Que: The resource local_sensitive_file.name is now created as:
Ans: list

Que: What is the id for the resource element at index 1?
Ans: Terraform show command gives below output:
b90c7e58c1fd82cf9cbe3ddfea5a78edbc9555254a9fff9e"
    directory_permission = "0700"
    file_permission      = "0700"
    filename             = "/root/user-data"
    id                   = "6b32344cb73c40d126d99ce62309878befca64ce"

6b32344cb73c40d126d99ce62309878befca64ce

Ans: How many files were actually created when apply was run?
1

Que: We have now created a variables.tf file in the same configuration directory. Update the main.tf file to make use of the list type variable defined for the filename argument.
Use count to loop through all the elements of this list and do not use hard-coded values.
Ans: 
Improvised code:
resource "local_sensitive_file" "name" {
filename = var.users[count.index]
content = var.content
count = length(var.users)
}

Que: We have reverted back to the old configuration file and cleaned up the resources created so far.
A variable called users now has default values added to it.
What type of variable is it?
Ans:
variable "users" {
type = list(string)
default = [ "/root/user10", "/root/user11", "/root/user12", "/root/user10"]
}
variable "content" {
default = "password: S3cr3tP@ssw0rd"
}
list(string)


Que: Can the same elements in this list be used as it is for a set instead?
Ans: No, Duplication is not allowed
