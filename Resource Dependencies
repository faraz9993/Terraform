Que: Which argument should be used to explicitly set dependencies for a resource?
Ans: depends_on

Que: Resource A relies on another Resource B but doesn't access any of its attributes in its own arguments. What is this type of dependency called?
Ans: Explicit dependency

Que: How do we make use of implicit dependency?
Ans: Reference expression

Que: In the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/key-generator, create a file called key.tf with the following specifications:
Resource Type: tls_private_key
Resource Name: pvtkey
algorithm: RSA
rsa_bits: 4096
When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.
If unsure, refer to the documentation.
Ans:
resource "tls_private_key" "pvtkey" {
algorithm = "RSA"
rsa_bits = 4096
}

Que: Now, let's use the private key created by this resource in another resource of type local file. Update the key.tf file with the requirements:

Resource Name: key_details
File Name: /root/key.txt
Content: use a reference expression to use the attribute called private_key_pem of the pvtkey resource.
When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.
Ans: 
resource "local_file" "key_details" {
  content  = tls_private_key.pvtkey.private_key_pem
  filename = "/root/key.txt"
}
