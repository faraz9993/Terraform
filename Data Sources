Que: A data source once created, can be used to create, update, and destroy infrastructure?
True or False?
Ans: False


Que: A data source can be created using the data block.
True or False?
Ans: True

Que: A new configuration directory has been created at /root/terraform-projects/project-lexcorp. A data source block is defined in the main.tf file to read the contents of an existing file.
There is also an output variable that uses reference expression to print the file content using this data source. However, there is something wrong!
Troubleshoot and fix the issue.
When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply to create the datasource. The configuration should print the output variable correctly.
Ans: 
Given code:
output "os-version" {
value = data.local_file.content
}
datasource "local_file" "os" {
filename = "/etc/os-release"
}

Improvised code:
output "os-version" {
value = data.local_file.os.content
}
data "local_file" "os" {
filename = "/etc/os-release"
}

Que: We have now created a new configuration file called ebs.tf within the same configuration directory we have been working on.
What is the resource type that we are working with here?
data "aws_ebs_volume" "gp2_volume" {
most_recent = true

filter {
name = "volume-type"
values = ["gp2"]
}
}
	
aws_ebs_volume

Que: Once this data source is created, how do we fetch the Volume Id for the resource that is created in AWS?
Ans: volume_id

Que: Another file called s3.tf has now been created. It too has a data source that will be used to read data of an existing s3 bucket.
Ans: However, there is a mistake in the argument used. What is wrong here?

Original code:
data "aws_s3_bucket" "selected" {
bucket_name = "bucket.test.com"
}

Improvised code:
data "aws_s3_bucket" "selected" {
bucket = "bucket.test.com"
}

bucket_name is not a valid argument
