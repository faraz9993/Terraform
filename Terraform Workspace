Que: When we start off and create a configuration in terraform, what is the workspace that is created, to begin with?
Ans: defaut

Que: Navigate to the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire. We have a few configuration files already created here. How may workspaces are created for this configuration currently?
Ans: 1

Que: Create three new workspaces called us-payroll, uk-payroll and india-payroll.
Ans:
terraform workspace new us-payroll
terraform workspace new uk-payroll
terraform workspace new india-payroll

Que: Now, go to us-payroll workspace.
terraform workspace select us-payroll 

Info: Where would the state file for the workspace called india-payroll be stored??
Choose the correct path relative to the current configuration directory (/root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire)

Que: Let's now write the main.tf file to make use of the same module that we saw in the terraform modules lecture.
The project-sapphire configuration directory will be used to deploy the same payroll application stack in different regions.
The module is located at the path /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app.
Ans:
variable "app_region" {
default = "us-east-1"
}L
variable "ami" {
type = string
default = "ami-24e140119877avm"
}
variable "bucket" {
default = "flexit-payroll-alpha-22001c"
}

Que: What is the default value of the key called india-payroll for the variable ami?
variable "region" {
type = map
default = {
"us-payroll" = "us-east-1"
"uk-payroll" = "eu-west-2"
"india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"
}

}
variable "ami" {
type = map
default = {
"us-payroll" = "ami-24e140119877avm"
"uk-payroll" = "ami-35e140119877avm"
"india-payroll" = "ami-55140119877avm"
}
}
	
Ans  ami-55140119877avm

Que: Now, update the main.tf of the root module to call the child module located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app. Adhere to the following specifications:
    1. module name: payroll_app
    2. This module expects two mandatory arguments:

a. app_region - use the values from variable called region

b. Ami - use the values from the variable called ami
    3. The values for these two arguments should be selected based on the workspace you are on.


For example, if on us-payroll workspace, the app_region should be us-east-1 and the ami ami-24e140119877avm OR for uk-payroll, the app_region should be eu-west-2 and the ami ami-35e140119877avm e.t.c .
Once ready, run terraform init. You don't have to create(apply) the resources yet!
