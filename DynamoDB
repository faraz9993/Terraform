Que: In this lab, we will work with DynamoDB tables using terraform.
The configuration directories have been created under /root/terraform-projects/DynamoDB.

We have already created a resource block for a DynamoDB table inside /root/terraform-projects/DynamoDB/project-sapphire-user-data/.
But something is wrong with this configuration. Try running a terraform plan or validate and identify the cause of the failure.
Ans:
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "project_sapphire_user_data" {
name = "userdata"
billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
hash_key = "UserId"

attribute {
name = "Name"
type = "S"
}
}

Error: 2 errors occurred:
│       * all attributes must be indexed. Unused attributes: ["Name"]
│       * all indexes must match a defined attribute. Unmatched indexes: ["UserId"]
Ans Attribute for primary key is missing

QUe: Let's fix that now! Update the main.tf file so that it uses an attribute for the Primary/Hash Key.
Ans: Note that the UserId should be a number.
Once ready, run a terraform init, plan and apply.
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "project_sapphire_user_data" {
name = "userdata"
billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
hash_key = "UserId"

attribute {
name = "UserId"
type = "N"
}
}
Terraform init, plan and apply commands ran successfully

Que: Another table has been created using the configuration in the directory /root/terraform-projects/DynamoDB/project-sapphire-inventory.
Navigate to this directory and inspect the configuration.

What is the name of the DynamoDB table resource that is created by this configuration?
Ans:
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "project_sapphire_inventory" {
name = "inventory"
billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
hash_key = "AssetID"

attribute {
name = "AssetID"
type = "N"
}
attribute {
name = "AssetName"
type = "S"
}
attribute {
name = "age"
type = "N"
}
attribute {
name = "Hardware"
type = "B"
}
global_secondary_index {
name = "AssetName"
hash_key = "AssetName"
projection_type = "ALL"
}
global_secondary_index {
name = "age"
hash_key = "age"
projection_type = "ALL"
}
global_secondary_index {
name = "Hardware"
hash_key = "Hardware"
projection_type = "ALL"
}
}
Ans  project_sapphire_inventory

Que: What is the name of DynamoDB table created?
Ans: inventory


Que: How many attributes are defined in this table currently?
Ans: 4

Que: Now, let's add an item to this table called inventory. Use the following specifications and update the main.tf file:
Resource Name: upload
Table = Use reference expression to the table called inventory
Hash Key = Use reference expression to use the primary key used by the table inventory
Use the below data for item:

"AssetID": {"N": "1"},
"AssetName": {"S": "printer"},
"age": {"N": "5"},
"Hardware": {"B": "true" }
when ready, run terraform init, plan and apply
Just added the given code as it is.
Terraform init, plan and apply commands ran successfully.
