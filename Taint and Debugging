Que: Which environment variable should be used to export the logs to a specific path? If unsure, refer to the documentation. Documentation tab is available at the top right.
Ans: TF_LOG_PATH

Que: Can you export the debug logs from terraform just by setting TF_LOG_PATH environment variable and providing a path as the value to this variable?
Ans: No

Que: We have a configuration directory called /root/terraform-projects/ProjectA. Enable logging with the log level set to ERROR and then export the logs the path /tmp/ProjectA.log.
Once the environment variables are set, run a terraform init and apply.
It's OK if this results in an error. Do not change any configuration files before you export the logs!
Ans:
Given code:
resource "aws_instance" "ProjectA" {
ami = "ami-0c9bfc21ac5bf10eb"
instance_type = "t2.large"
}

Improvised code:


Que: Now navigate to /root/terraform-projects/ProjectB. We already have a main.tf file created for provisioning an AWS EC2 instance with the tag Name: projectb_webserver.
Run a terraform init and apply to provision this instance.
Ans: Terraform init, plan and apply commands ran successfully

Que: Now, try running a terraform plan again. What is the effect?
Ans: Resources will be replaced

Que: Why is the resource called ProjectB being replaced?
Ans: Project B resource is tained

Que: Untaint the resource called ProjectB so that the resource is not replaced any more.
Ans: The resource is currently tainted.
terraform untaint aws_instance.ProjectB
