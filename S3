In this lab, we will work on configuration directories that have been created under /root/terraform-projects/S3-Buckets.

Que: Lets first inspect the configuration files in the directory called MCU.
What is the AWS region configured for use in the provider block? (Assuming we do not pass in additional variables during command execution)
Ans:
Information provided in aws configuration file:
[default]
region = us-east-1
Ans us-east-1

Que: There is a resource block configured in the main.tf file in this configuration directory. What is the resource name that will be provisioned when we run terraform apply?
Ans: resource "aws_s3_bucket" "marvel-cinematic-universe" {
bucket = "mcu-202011121359"

}

Ans  marvel-cinematic-universe

Que: What is the current state of this configuration directory?
Ans Resources provisoned

Que: What is the name of S3 bucket that has been created?
Ans: mcu-202011121359

Que: What is the DNS domain name that is created for this bucket?
Ans: Ran the terraform show command, got the below details:
bucket                      = "mcu-202011121359"
    bucket_domain_name          = "mcu-202011121359.s3.amazonaws.com"
    bucket_regional_domain_name = "mcu-202011121359.s3.amazonaws.com"
    force_destroy               = false

Ans  mcu-202011121359.s3.amazonaws.com

Que: The main.tf file is empty. Use it to create a new S3 with the following specifications:
Ans: resource name: dc_bucket
bucket name: dc_is_better_than_marvel
Once the resource block is complete, run a terraform init, plan and apply to try and create the bucket.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "dc_bucket" {
bucket = "dc_is_better_than_marvel"
}

terraform init and plan ran successfully

Que: Why did the terraform apply command fail?
Ans: Invalid bucket name

Que: Lets fix that now and change the bucket name so that it uses dashes (-) instead of underscore(_).
Ans:
resource name: dc_bucket
bucket name: dc-is-better-than-marvel


Que: Once the resource block is complete, run a terraform init, plan and apply to try and create the bucket.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "dc_bucket" {
bucket = "dc-is-better-than-marvel" 
}

terraform init, plan and apply command ran successfully

Que: Lets do that now and upload this image to the s3 bucket! Update the main.tf file with the following specifications:
    • Bucket: pixar-studios-2020
    • Key: woody.jpg
    • Source: /root/woody.jpg
    • Use object (resource) Name: upload
Once ready, proceed to run terraform init, plan and apply.
Ans:
resource "aws_s3_object" "upload" {
bucket = "pixar-studios-2020"
key = "woody.jpg"
source = "/root/woody.jpg"
}
terraform init, plan and apply commands ran successfully.
